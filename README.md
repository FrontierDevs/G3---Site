__Genisys, but better than anytime before__

Introduction
-------------
Genisys3 is one of several derived projects resulting from the inactivity of **[PocketMine/PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP)** which is now commonly known as **[pmmp/PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)** and **[iTXTech/Genisys](https://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys)**Â . It has many gameplay features implemented which PocketMine-MP does not since Minecraft PE v0.11.

[Genisys](https://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys/) has officially died and [FrontierDevs](https://github.com/FrontierDevs) are reviving it under the name [Genisys3](http://github.genisys3.org)
